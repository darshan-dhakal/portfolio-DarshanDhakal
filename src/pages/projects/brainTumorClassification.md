As a final year project, I collaborated to build an intelligent brain tumor detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning with VGG16. Trained on 7,000+ MRI images (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor), the model performs high-accuracy classification with advanced preprocessing like data augmentation, skull stripping, and RGB conversion.
We fine-tuned VGG16, added Dense, Dropout, and Softmax layers, and evaluated performance using accuracy, recall, precision, and confusion matrix. Designed for real-world use, the system integrates with a MERN-based web interface, delivering structured outputs and over 95% classification accuracy.
